        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I started my journey in 2025, inspired by my father’s legacy in the
          world of programming. Watching him solve complex problems with elegant
          code sparked something in me—and I knew I wanted to follow in his
          footsteps. What began as curiosity quickly evolved into a full-blown
          passion. I immersed myself in learning everything I could, from
          foundational languages to modern frameworks, and discovered not just a
          skill, but a calling. Programming has become more than just a career
          path—it’s a creative outlet, a puzzle, and a way to build solutions
          that make a difference. Whether I’m debugging a tricky issue or
          architecting a new project from scratch, I find joy in the process and
          pride in the progress. Today, I continue to grow, explore, and push
          boundaries in tech, driven by the same spark that lit the way in 2025.
